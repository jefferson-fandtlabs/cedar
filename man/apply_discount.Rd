\title{Apply Time Discounting to Costs}
\usage{
apply_discount(cost, time_periods, discount_rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{cost}{Numeric. The cost per time period (e.g., annual cost)}

\item{time_periods}{Numeric. The number of time periods over which the cost occurs}

\item{discount_rate}{Numeric. The discount rate as a decimal (e.g., 0.03 for 3%)}
}
\value{
Numeric. The discounted present value of the cost
}
\description{
Calculates the present value of a cost that occurs over multiple time periods
using a discount rate. This is an internal helper function used by
\code{\link{calculate_composite_costs}}.
}
\details{
The function calculates the present value using the standard discounting formula:

\deqn{PV = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{cost}{(1 + r)^t}}

where:
\itemize{
  \item PV = Present Value
  \item cost = Cost per time period
  \item r = Discount rate
  \item T = Total number of time periods
  \item t = Time period index (1 to T)
}
}
\examples{
# Calculate present value of $5000/year for 3 years at 3\% discount rate
apply_discount(5000, 3, 0.03)
# Returns: 14282.46

# No discounting (0\% rate)
apply_discount(5000, 3, 0)
# Returns: 15000

# Single period (equivalent to simple discounting)
apply_discount(5000, 1, 0.03)
# Returns: 4854.369
