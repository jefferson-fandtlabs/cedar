\title{Specify Health Outcome Components for Composite Calculations}
\usage{
specify_health_outcome_components(components)
}
\arguments{
\item{components}{A data frame or tibble specifying how health outcomes should
be calculated from base outcome values. Must contain the following columns:
\itemize{
  \item outcome_label: Character. Name for the composite health outcome
  \item base_outcome_name: Character (optional for "life_years"). Name of the
    base health outcome value (must exist in base_outcomes list passed to
    calculate_composite_health_outcomes). Can be omitted entirely if all rows
    use outcome_type = "life_years", or set to NA for individual life_years rows.
  \item outcome_type: Character. Type of outcome calculation. Must be one of:
    \itemize{
      \item "utility_to_qaly": Health utility value that will be converted to QALY
        by multiplying by duration in years
      \item "life_years": Life years calculation. Automatically uses a base value
        of 1.0 (i.e., 1 year per year of duration). The base_outcome_name is not
        needed and will be ignored if provided.
      \item "qaly_direct": Pre-calculated QALY value (no conversion needed)
    }
  \item duration_unit: Character. Unit of duration. Must be one of:
    "hours", "days", "weeks", "months", "years"
  \item edge_from: Integer. Parent node number
  \item edge_to: Integer. Child node number
  \item duration_value: Numeric (optional). Duration value to use. If NA or
    missing, will be looked up from edge_properties using the duration_unit
    column name
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with class "health_outcome_components" containing the
  validated specification
}
\description{
Validates and structures health outcome component data frames for use with
\code{\link{calculate_composite_health_outcomes}}. This function ensures that
health outcome specifications have all required columns, valid outcome types,
and valid duration units.
}
\details{
This function performs the following validations:
\itemize{
  \item Ensures all required columns are present (base_outcome_name is optional)
  \item Validates that outcome_type values are one of the allowed types
  \item Validates that duration_unit values are one of the allowed units
  \item Validates base_outcome_name handling: if the column is missing, all rows
    must be "life_years"; if present, NA values are only allowed for "life_years"
  \item Adds duration_value column if not present (initialized to NA)
  \item Converts the input to a tibble if it isn't already
}

The outcome_type determines how the calculation is performed:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{utility_to_qaly}: The base outcome value is a health utility
    (typically 0-1). The function will multiply this by the duration in years
    to calculate QALYs. For example, a utility of 0.8 over 2 years = 1.6 QALYs.
  \item \strong{life_years}: Automatically uses a base value of 1.0,
    representing 1 year of life per year of duration. The base_outcome_name
    column is optional for this outcome type and will be ignored if provided.
    Duration is converted to years and multiplied by 1.0 to get life years.
  \item \strong{qaly_direct}: The base outcome value is already a QALY value
    and no conversion is needed. Duration is still converted to years for
    consistency but may not be used in calculation.
}

Duration values can be specified in two ways:
\enumerate{
  \item Directly in the components data frame using the duration_value column
  \item Looked up from edge_properties based on the duration_unit (when
    duration_value is NA)
}

When duration_value is NA, the calculation function will look for a column
in edge_properties with the same name as duration_unit (e.g., "days", "months")
to find the duration for each edge.
