\title{Compute Time Offsets for Edges in a Decision Tree}
\usage{
compute_edge_offsets(edge_properties)
}
\arguments{
\item{edge_properties}{A data frame containing edge definitions with columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{from_node}: Starting node ID
  \item \code{to_node}: Ending node ID
  \item \code{duration}: Optional duration of the edge (can be NA or missing)
  \item \code{time_offset}: Optional manual offset override
}}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to edge_properties but with an added (or updated)
  \code{time_offset} column containing the computed cumulative time offsets.
}
\description{
Calculates cumulative time offsets for each edge in a decision tree, starting
from the root node (node 1) at time t=0. The offset represents when each edge's
time period begins in the overall timeline.
}
\details{
The function traces paths from the root node (node 1) through the tree,
accumulating time as it goes. For each edge:
\itemize{
  \item The offset = cumulative time at the from_node
  \item The cumulative time at to_node = cumulative time at from_node + edge duration
  \item NA or missing durations are treated as 0
  \item If time_offset is already present in edge_properties, it is preserved
}
}
\examples{
# Simple sequential chain
edges <- data.frame(
  from_node = c(1, 4, 7, 11),
  to_node = c(4, 7, 11, 13),
  duration = c(0, 1, 1, 1)
)
compute_edge_offsets(edges)
# Returns offsets: [0, 0, 1, 2]
