\title{Convert Duration to Years}
\usage{
convert_duration_to_years(duration, duration_unit)
}
\arguments{
\item{duration}{Numeric. The duration value to convert}

\item{duration_unit}{Character. The unit of the duration. Must be one of:
"hours", "days", "weeks", "months", "years"}
}
\value{
Numeric. The duration converted to years
}
\description{
Converts time durations from various units (hours, days, weeks, months) to years.
This is an internal helper function used by
\code{\link{calculate_composite_health_outcomes}} to standardize all durations
to years for QALY calculations.
}
\details{
The function uses the following conversion factors:
\itemize{
  \item hours: 1 year = 8766 hours (365.25 days * 24 hours)
  \item days: 1 year = 365.25 days (accounts for leap years)
  \item weeks: 1 year = 52.17857 weeks (365.25 / 7)
  \item months: 1 year = 12 months
  \item years: 1 year = 1 year (no conversion)
}

The conversion uses 365.25 days per year to account for leap years, which is
the standard in epidemiology and health economics.
}
\examples{
# Convert 6 months to years
convert_duration_to_years(6, "months")
# Returns: 0.5

# Convert 90 days to years
convert_duration_to_years(90, "days")
# Returns: 0.2464066

# Convert 2 weeks to years
convert_duration_to_years(2, "weeks")
# Returns: 0.03833

# Years remain unchanged
convert_duration_to_years(5, "years")
# Returns: 5
